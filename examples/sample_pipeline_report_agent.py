"""Barndoor demo: pull a Salesforce pipeline report and post it to Notion.

This sample shows how an agent can use **two** MCP server integrations
(simultaneously) inside CrewAI:

• Salesforce (read-only) – fetch the latest pipeline metrics.
• Notion (read-write) – update or create a report page.

Run with:
    python sample_pipeline_report_agent.py

Environment / prerequisites
---------------------------
1. Ensure both Salesforce and Notion MCP servers exist for your org and that your
   user has *connected* them.  If not, the helper below will launch the OAuth
   flows.
2. Make sure the repo-root `.env` contains:
       AUTH0_DOMAIN=…
       AGENT_CLIENT_ID=…
       AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET=…
   and export the desired ``MODE`` (localdev | development | production) –
   for shared DEV simply:

       export MODE=development
